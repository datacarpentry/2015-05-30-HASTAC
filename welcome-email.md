Hello Data Carpentry workshop participant! We're looking forward to the workshop at HASTAC on May 30-31, and have some information below on logistics and what to do before the workshop.

Cam Macdonell <macdonellc4@macewan.ca>, Sean Pue <pue@msu.edu> and Tracy Teal <tkteal@datacarpentry.org>
will be the instructors for the workshop, and please don't hesitate to contact 
them with any questions.

We do have a waitlist for the workshop, so if you find you can't attend please let 
Sean know (pue@msu.edu).

General information and logistics for the workshop is available at the wiki, and it will continue to be updated before and throughout the workshop with any additional information.

** Before the Workshop **

To get the workshop off to a good start and make the best use of the time (and network bandwidth), before the workshop please do two things:

1. Install the relevant software: http://datacarpentry.github.io/2015-05-30-HASTAC/install.html
2. Take the pre-workshop survey: 
http://ucbpsych.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0TFu7FTlG0DoM7P
The survey information helps us know who the participants will be and most effectively tailor the workshop for the group.

Links to both of these instructions are also available on the wiki under the 
'Before the Workshop section'

** Help Desk During HASTAC **

During the Friday lunch break during the HASTAC conference, we will have a help desk by the exhibitor desk in the Big Ten Room of the Kellogg Center. If you need any help, stop by then.

Thank you for doing this work to get setup before the workshop, and we look forward to meeting you next week!

Best,
-Tracy, Cam and Sean
