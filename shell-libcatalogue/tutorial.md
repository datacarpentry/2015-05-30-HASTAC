## Opening

In designing these lessons it is understood that there is not a single type of
librarian. Different librarians have different tasks and some many be relevant
to programming, some not

These lessons are designed to introduce librarians to programming by using
tasks that they will find relevant.  The first lesson is meant to simple to
introduce concepts of programming such as reading files, looping and working
with strings.  The example is based on a file containing a circulation card.
While perhaps not realistic, the data will be easily understandable and relevant
in other contexts.

The other two examples are intended to represent actual librarian tasks that would
benefit from automated processing.
