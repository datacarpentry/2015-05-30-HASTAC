Christmas For The Children.
What time and trouble we take to
make the ehihlreii happy at Chi htinaM.
For this ono day that is theirs. we. nui.st
see to it that liothiuir mars the bright
iie.;.H oft he hours. No sour looks ami
crttHH wot ils to the little folks and who is
it ran coahout with a Inn;: face and with
sharp words wlu ii t hildn n all around
aie brunniiiii: over with excess of
joy. Among the many ways of making
them happy at thiseason is the usual
observance of christm as ee by the
different churches and Mimlay Schools
in th- way of dt coratiotis and pro
grams. Never, as l"!:g as the wmM
lasts, will children fjrow weary or tired
of t his observance. There is always
the lrthm!'i of surprises and tin- hi
tie hvart beats quicker week.-, before,
counting the time until Santa 'l.uis
shall eo'ne. At the lOclple rhureli
a haiiil-'ine tit e stood ,oiu platform
to crilini: hanging its branches with
the weight ot riiristmas gilt , other
decorations enhanced the brightness
and attractivcnc.-s of the pleasant lit
tle church which was lilted to the dour
on W-dmsdav evening by friends
I conn to hear the special exercises jro.
jvidvd by the children and add their
! mite to the general joy. At the. M. M.
church a circle of Christmas tn es was
made and alter the program of vmg
and recitations was eudid the.se were
swung open, revealing the hosts of
presents all lighted by electricity. It
w.isa piettv scene aiul much enjoyed
by all. The jM-ople of the M. P. Church
had provided for their oiilig people a
revolving tower "T lighthouse lighted
by the electric power and hung with
numerous hcautilul gilts. This novel
scheme proved vt ry attract iw. The
program was well prepared ami also
enjoyed. At the Presbyterian Church
two trees graced the platform and the
children were made more than happy
when after pleasing exercises appro
priate to Christmas title the hoiintitul
ClftS were distributed among them.
Preparations hae been going on sev
eral weeks for the observam f Christ
mas eve ami rehearsals for the different
programs hnve been numerous, which
j'crhaps have been wearisome for the
instructors but the joy of the children
when Santa appeals overbalances all
the previous dillicultics and ever)bMy
is ready and willing to go through the
whole thing again when Christmas
rolls round the next year and for all
the wot k there is a certain unselfish
joy which pervades our tcii)g when we
ate doiim for others, w hich compensates
for everything. We are glad thero is a
Christmas.

Didn't Know His Father.
The following article is clipped from J
the J'oit Huron Daily 1 lines of Satur
day last: -
An old man climbed the court house
stairs this morning, and accosted
.Judge Stevens:
"Is this Where .lodge T.lpp.lll does
his courting."
"This is the place," replied Judge
Stevens.
"Well I would like to see him." said
the old man.
.Iildge Stevens escorted the visitor
througli the circuit court room and m
to tile judge's private o'Ihv.
The judge looked up fiuiti hit desk,
when the old gentleman cxcl.'tilo. d.
"How are you Harvey. I am more
th in gl.nl to st e you."
"You have the advantage of me."'
said .lodge Tappau. "I can't remem
ber . I" -ver having no t you before, but
I am i;lad to i. net yoi; just the same."
'I he two men clasped hands and
looked into each other's faces.
"No. can't place ou." said the
judge.
"1 used to know you when you were
a boy.' said the stranger. "l" lived in
Caseo. In tact 1 married your mother
and was somewhere around the (,iy
Jou Were born."
"Ureal Scott." exclaimed the Judge,
"is this my father. "
And so it lroed to be. The elder
Tappau left st. Clair county about 'J."

lie has Miice been engaged in the cattle
business. He is 7 years of ag and
concluded to journey east and visit his
son.

Roney's Boys All Right.
As predicted, Central Hall was well
Idled Tuesday evening to listen to the
n markahle musical talent of Henry
15. Policy and his boys. It was a line
concert ami the natural genius of these
young boys has been thoroughly
brought out bv Mr. IJoney who is one
of tlit; best of instructors, trainers ami
directors. The boys havo excellent
voices and their productions in dillerent
costume:, military, court, college, pa
triotic and Scottish won them great
applause from an enthusiastic audience.
Their work in a classical line was in
deed superb as all agreed, although it
isn't everyone w ho enjoys that style of
music, lint from start to finish their
program was rcpletu with numbeis of
varied style which, take it as a whole,
was ierfectly satisfactory to the en
tire audience who left the hall Voicing
much admiration for the little fellows,
wno through hard work, have achieved
such success as falls to the lot of few
singers.
Had Two Wives.
During the past week the the execu
tive committee of tho Modern Macca
bees has taken evidencu to determine
who was entitled to the 2,U) insur
ance on the life of the late John Cooper.
Mr. Cooper was a brakemau on the
(irantl Trunk between Port Huron and
Detroit. A year and a half ago his
wife. May Cooper, began divorce pro
ceedings in the circuit court of St. Clair
county. Cooper believing that tho di
vorce was granted, married llmma
Llnck, of PruwnCity. .lust before his
death, which occurred in Detroit four
months ago, ho transferred his insur
ance policy to his second wife. After
his death his first wife put in a claim
for the money. J'oth wives wrro rep
resented before the executive commit
tee last week by attorneys. The lirst
wife maintained that a divorce was
never granted and that she was en
titled to tho insurance.
Joseph Walsh, one of the attorneys
in the case, told The Times this morn
ing that a satisfactory settlement had
been made and that the money would
be paid in nearlv eiul shares to both
women. Port lluron Daily Times.
