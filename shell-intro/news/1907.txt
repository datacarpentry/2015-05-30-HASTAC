II. S. UGTIRE COURSE.
Two weeks from next Tuesday night
Feb. 12 is the date for our third num
ber on the lecture course. Dr. Mattl
son Wilbur Chase, of Chicago, a man
who has been before the public for ov
er twenty years, will lecture on the
subject, "Trifles or Straws picked up by
the Wayside." His lectures abound in
anecdote, illustration and humor.
One who has heard his lecture has
said of it, "You laugh because you
have to and you learn because you can't
help it."
SOMETHING NLW AND NOVEL.
As a man, shoes from whose factory
are sold and worn in our town, and be
cause he is our brother, we feel consid
erable interest in the business and pros
perity of Henry D. Menzies, president
of the Menzies Shoe Company of De
troit. The business of this plant lias
grown to large proportions and it is
now located on (Iratiot Ave. turning
out 2,000 pairs of shoes jkt day. The
company's specialties are elk skin and
work shoes which Mr. Menzies claims
their success due to, the shape of which
has been his own idea. A novelty
which has lately been introduced into
this factory is a modern cafe .which
provides a splendid place for the em
ployees to get their dinners at cost.
The best of food in great variety is
served neatly and well as we ourselves
can testify, having taken two dinners
there on our way to and from Monroe.
It is said that there are only two other
shoe manufacturers in the United
States who have established cafes in
their institutions, one being that of
Thos. (J. Plant of Poston, who puts out
the "(Jueen Quality" shoes. It is an
innovation which gives to the numer
ous employes a comfortable place for
their nooning, besides supplying them
with clean, nutritious food, which Mr.
Menzies sees to is right.
It takes industry and enterprise to
work a business up to the standard
which this one has attained, but the
members of the Menzies Shoe Comp-
ady have these attributes and success
Is theirs.
Peavis & Hutchinson are giving
off on all shoes during their inventory

MAY TIGHT T00O TRUST.
Dudley, of Owosso. Tls Said. Is Likely to
Start In Business on His Own Hook.
Owosso, Mich., .Jan. 22. The resigna
tion of K. F. Dudley, local manager of
the American Farm Product Co., is be
lieved to forecast a war to the death
between the so-called "food trust" and
a man who was formerly a trusted em
ploye. I'ight months ago the American
Farm Product Co. was organized in
New York with a capital stock of 17,
(KXMXX), and with such linanciers as T.
F. ityan. Harry Payne Whitney ami
Levi P. Morton behind it. One of the
first acts of the organization was to
buy Dudley's factory in this city.
It is probably the largest plant for
the renovating of butter and the man
ufacture of creamery butter in the Uni
ted States. Dudley is said to have been
paid in the neighborhood of half a mil
lion dollars for the plant, and was re
tained as manager at a salary of 81,0(10
contract.
per year, under an ironclad, live-year
It is said that til' present trouble is
due to Dudley's impatience of dictation
from the Mev York magnates in con
trol and that the break took place on
Monday.
It is said that Dudley has already
started the war by mailing circulars to
the trade, announcing that his son,
Harry Dudley, is soon to start a rival
creamery in this city. Dudley lias been
succeeded here, temporarily, as mana
ger, by A. S. Hoist, of Chicago, who
has been in the ollice for several months.
Harry Dudley has been superintendent
in the local plant.
It is said that the nroduct company
is relying on the validity of their con
tract with Dudley, and will bring suit
if the Owosso man even puts foot in
another plant during the life of the
contract. ,
The above ought to open the eyes of
the farmers in Yale vicinity. It has
been told them time and again that the
"American Farm Products Co." was
nothing but a "trust" whose business is
to drive to the wall all local butter
manufactories or creameries, then give
the farmers just what they see lit for
their cream. Thin& of giving a mana
ger 88,0U() per year, and the other enor
mous expenses that are being made. Is
any one foolish enough to think the
trust can make money and pay the same
for cream as other concerns are now
paying? Certainly not. That is where
the )?17,KK),(XX) capital comes in. They
can alTord to do business at a loss until
every creamery in the country is silenc
ed then prices for "farm products" will
be "fixed" so the deficit will be quickly
balanced and "Standard Putter" will
have become a synonym for "Standard
Oil." Editor.
1 SCHOOL ITEMS.
Quite a large number in the higher
grades escaped final examinations by
keeping their standings up to !K) per
cent and by not having below 75 per
cent in any monthly examination. Such
pupils are rejoicing in the two holidays
while their less fortunate, comrades are
engaged in writing the tests.
Next Monday will begin the new
semester's work. New classes will be
started in various high school subjects
including Algebra, ilotany, English
History, American Literature, etc.
Pupils who are expecting to enter the
ninth grade either this semester or next
September would find next week a par
ticularly favorable time to enroll in the
Yale schools. In many instances en
rolling now . would save live months
time for the pupil.

MONROE. Tilt FLORAL CITY.
site
the
the
Twenty-five years ago the little city
of Monroe, away down in the south
eastern part of the state, was lazily sun
ning itself along both banks of the
ltiver Raisin, or shivering in the icy
northeast breezes which In winter blew
the whole length of Lake Erie and
found their first victims in the ancient
and historic commonwealth. It was
content to live on its past reputation
as the biggest nursery town in the
west, and its historic fame as the
of the "Massacre of the Kaisin,"
scene of the "Toledo War" and
home of (Jeneral Custer.
If any energetic and visionary inhab
itant wanted to rudely awaken it from
its Kip Van Winkle slumbers, it sat
down on him emphatically and resumed
its nap.
Put "the world rolls round, the world
rolls round, ' and in due time its con
servative and rigid old leaders one by
one crept silently up to the summit of
the only hill in town and slept the sleep
that knows no waking. Those who
followed them appreciated the benefits
ot modern progress but they had a
rather rocky path. If they attempted
any improvements, they were rewarded
by detailed dirgrams of what the old
town was. IJuckets of cold water were
poured over their enthusiasm and, be
draggled, thty sought other fields for
the display of their energies, it s aw
fully hard for a fellow to outlive a bad
reputation, and it's just as hard for a
city. Jlut by dint of everlastingly
keeping at it, the way newspaper men
have, the old town has chirked up un
til it has burst its garments in every
direction but one, and the Lake lies
there, and is complacently pulling
plums out of its pie and calling atten
tion to itself like Jack Horner of pleas
ant memory. '
A Michigan midwinter, with its
leaden days and abbreviated hours of
sunshine is hardly a fair time to ex
plore unknown territory, but the mem
bers of the Eastern Michigan Press
Club found in the quaint and historic
old city of Monroe, one of the pleasure
spots of the peninsula. ' It has out
grown its ancient reputation and in
commerce and industry is taking the
lead of many of its neighbors who have
been content to greet its efforts with a
hoarse hoot of derision. Situated on
the west end of Lake Erie in the past
stately steamers hate brought the
sturdy and hopeful sons of the east to
its shores, to aid in subduing the wild
erness of early Michigan. It was the
terminus of one of the state roads in
the disastrous history "of internal im-
f rovement8,"vhleh at one time, was a
ad of the state, and being on the direct
route between the cities of Detroit and
Toledo, it was early blessed with rail
road communication of more than
usual excellence. Today it offers faci
lities which are unsurpassed. The
Lake Shore, the Michigan Central, the
Pere Marquette, C II. IK JHg I'our
Trunk all run through, it . allording
sites for manufactures and for ship
ping enjoyed by but few of the Michi
gan cities.
