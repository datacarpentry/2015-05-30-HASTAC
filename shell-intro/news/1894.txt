A CHAPTER OF THE DOINGS OF
MICHIG ANDERS.
KlUmartm County the Scene of Bloitt
11 urdrr. Well-to-do farmer's Wife
Suicided Near Itcrricu Springs. The
LuUciily Homeopathic Ieati Itctdgus.
A Most llruliil Jliirtlcr.
Mrs. ICphriain Maddoek left the bak
ery of Toynlou fc Kudner, at rontiac,
ut 10 o'clock at niprht, with a loaf of
bread. She lived in a cottage in the
eastern portion of the city, quite a dis
tance from the business section. She
passed down Huron fctreet, east to
.Mechanic street, where ishe was found
lcud, lying1 on her face in a pool of
blood. The body was taken to the
horue of her daughcr nnd an autopsy
was held, which disclosed a wound
madj by a blunt instrument which
pei etiated the scalp, and produced an
extensive fracture of the left side, of
the skull, four inches back of the loft
ar a wound Mil'.ieient to produce in
stil i.t death.
In paying for the bread she had
taken a wallet from her pocket, and
the theory is that this action was ob- j
served by some one who thought she
had considerable money, an.l that the
motive for the hellish deed was rob
bery. Her children say she had a little
money in the pnrso and when the body
was examined the purse was missing1.
The deceased was 08 years of age an I
lived peaceably with her husband.
She leaves six children.
Very Mysterious M tinier.
A most cowardly and mysterious
murder was that of the assassination
of William Wick wire and the shooting1
of his sister at the former's home in
Climax township, Kalamazoo county.
About 7 o'clock ut iiight a knock was
heard at the back door. An adopted
boy opened the door and a man with a
mask on his face asked for Mr. Wick
wire. Without waiting for a reply he
pushed past tho boy and entered the
dining room where Wickwire's wife
and sister were sitting. The latter
noticed that the intruder had in his
hand a revolver and she tried to stop
him, but he rushed into the next room
where he met Wiekwirc who was just
coming out to see the cause of the
noise. Tho masked man at once
opened fire. Three shots struck Wiek
wire and one struck his sister. The
three grappled with tho desperado,
but he escaped before the neighbors
whom the boy had called could arrive.
No motive ior the strange crime is
known. Wickwire's iujuries were
fatal, but his lister was scarcely hurt.
Train Wrecker' Trial lllocked.
The examination of the five men
charged with train wrecking' at Uattle
Creek, has taken a new turn and
dropped a bomb at the prosecutor's
feet. When the first witness was
called it was ltodevvig, upon whom the
prosecution depended for so much con
victing testimony, but ho created a
sensation by positivelj' refusing to say
a word. An adjournment was then
taken uutil cveniug, when Stanley
Knowles, who lias so often told the
talc of tho clawbar to the delight of
the prosecution, was placed on the
ctand. He also refused to testify.
This virtually blocked the examination
and the court adjourned until Jan. 2,
ordering' the five men to jail.

NEWS OF ALL KINDS.
EVENTS OF GENERAL INTEREST
AND IMPORTANCE.
Port Arthur, the 1'rhle of China, Surren
dered to the Japanese Chinese Loss,
1,000 Alea; Jap, 250. Vwst Stores of
Supplies, etc., Captured. Other News.
Fort Arthur Ha Ftil'ea.
Che Foo: Dispatches have been re
ceived here stating1 that the Japanese
captured Port Arthur after 18 hours'
lighting. The Japanese army, under
the command of Field Marshal Count
03'ama, minister of war, consisted of
about 30,000 men. The Japanese navy
did not participate with the exception
of some of the torpedo boats.
Fartlcul irs of the Cnrturoof Port Arthur,
London: Tne confirmation of the re
port of the capture of Port Arthur by
the Japanese has been rejeived, to
gether with particulars of tho lighting'
in detail. As has been told in these,
dispatches, Port Arthur hail been Mir
rou tided for miles with fortified hills,
and in anticipation of this attack the
Chinese, under direction of tho Euro
pean ollicers, had planted mines in all
the roads leading to tho stronghold
and had connected them with I'ort
Arthur by electric wires. This neces
sitated caution on the part of the
Japanese, and consequently they cut
roads through the woods and morasses
and hauled their light field pieces over
these for over 40 miles. Notwith
standing these delays the Japanese
crept nearer the point of attack with
commendable speed. No organized
resistance was offered by the Chinese
for three-fourths the distance, and on
Tuesday the lirst skirmish occurred in
which the Chinese soon retired in good
order. One fort and ono village were
captured by the Japanese and the fol
lowing morning they carried an ad
vantageous range of hills near Fort
Arthur with a rush. Guns were then
dragged up and fire opened. The
enemy returned the lire briskly. The
Japanese infantry advanced against a
well-directed lire without faltering.
Sbortlj' before U o'clock the fort was
carried by storm in a most gallant
fashion. The Chines-.; stood for a min
ute or two against the final onslaught,
lighting fiercely. Then thev lied to
ward the dockyards, 'lhe right divi
sion then advanced in force against the
Kokin-an fort, which was armed with
several heavy Krupp guns, which were
well served. Scores of men were
killed or wounded in this brief ad
vance. At noon the fort itself was
stormed and captuied after a short but
desperate fight. Hy 3 o'clock in the
afternoon the right division was in full
possession of the western part of the
stronghold.
Meanwhile the left division had been
engaged on the southeast where the
ground was less difficult, but far from
easy. Advanciug over the hills the
first division had to clear the enemy
out of some out-lying work apparently
of recent construction. The Japanese
artillery and Chinese guns in the forts
kept up a steady lire. The latter were
all heavy pieces and they pounded
away for some time at tho Japanese
infantry, who in the meantime were
advancing all along the line. The
final assault was splendidly delivered,
the enemy being driven headlong from
tho works after making a gallant
stand. Hv evening Port Arthur was
in possession of the Japanese, but the
enemy still held eight or ten redoubts
with a total of about 20 guns on the
coast line. Early Thursday morning
Lao Mu and other forts were attacked
in succession, all being captured with
out loss on tio Japanese side. It is
estimated that the Chineso loss was
over 1,000 killed and wounded and
20,000 were taken prisoners. The Jap
anese loss vras about 250 killed and
wounded.
The Japanese have taken quite 80
guns and the mortars that were in use
in the captured forts and many others
found in the dock, yard. They have
also captured an immense quantity of
ammunition, completely equipped tor
pedo stores and large quantities of
rice and beans.
Tho part taken in the battle by the
Japanese navy Vras that 23 torpedo
boats made a concerted rush upon the
cutraDCO of tks harbor of Port Arthur
at the same time that the Japanese
land forces attacked the place from
rear, while a heavy artillery fire was
poured into the Chinese, forts.
China Sends a Peaee l!niUary to Japan.
Tien Tsin: The chief of the imperial
customs here, Dc Ting, who was re
cently summoned to Pckin, has left
for Japan in order to urrangc terras of
peace.
Washington: The departure of the
Chinese custom- chief for Japan is re
garded by officials here as the result of
Japan's demand for a direct offer from
China. The De Ting mentioned in
the cable is said to be Dietering, a
German, who occupies the position of
commissioner of customs. An Associ
ated Press cable from Japan states
that China has intimated her willing
ness to pay an indemnity of 100,000,000
taels and in addition pay all the war
expenses incurred by Japan. This
would make the total offer of China
250,000,000 taels. The tael is a Chinese
silver coin worth about 75 cents, so
that the whole payment would bo ap
proximately 5175.000,000 American.
Washington: It has become known
that Japan has declined the advances
of President Cleveland as a mediator
for peace between China and Japan.
Tho correspondenca has been kept
secret but it is known that Japan sdid
plainly that all overtures for peace
must come directly from China.
Hawaiian Iloyai:is Talk Revolution.
Advices from Honolulu say: That
the government is still slightly in fear
of the royalists uprising has been evi
dent of iate. All tho guards in the
suburbs have been doubled, and a
closo watch has been kept on all sus
pected persons. The cause of this sud
den activity is tho discovery of a plot
to restore the ex-queen. A consider
able number of guns and ammunition
have been secretly brought hero dur
ing1 tho last few months and the royal
ists evidently intend to make use of
them. No uneasiness is felt by the
government party, however, which
seems perfectly well satisfied that it
can hold its-own.
Chlrm.Japtm War ioitdp.
The third army has left Ujinaon
aboard the transpor.s. The destina
tion of this army is not known but it
is rumored that it is intended to oper
ate in the Yang Tse Kiang districts of
China. Tho Vang Tse Kiang river has
u total course of 2,500 to 3.000 miles
and drains with its uumerout large
nllluents all tho central provinces for
China. The tido ascends it to Lake Po
Yang, 450 miles from tho sea beyond
which it is navigable for 250 miles. It
may be navigated for 200 miles from
its mouth by ship of the larget class
and about HO miles from the mouth is
situated the southern cap.tol of the
China. Nankin, one of tho mostlmport
fint cities of the empire. It is doubt
less Japan's intention to advance upon
Nankin.
I.I Huns Chun ST to Dethrone the Kmperor.
Wasldngton: A prominent member
of tho dip omatic world has received a
letter telling of a conspiracy now well
underway in China, which, if not
checked, will result in tho downfall of
the present government and this estab
lishment of another with Li Hung
Chang on the throne. this will be
aecompl.shcd by the murder or exiling
of the present emperor. Li Hung
Chang, rendered despcratn by the
abuse and degradation which has been
heaped upon him by tho emperor, has
concocted the scheme outlined above.
Ti e communication states that ho has
always had a contempt for the emperor
who is of the tartar race, believing
that China should be ruled by Chinese.
Cnclc Sum's New Treaty With Japan.
Washington: Secretary of State
Gresham, in behalf of the United
States, and Minister Kurino of Japan,
in behalf of his own country, have
uflixcd their signatures to a new treaty
of amity and commerce between this
country and Japan. The cLief feature
of the new treaty is in its recognition
of Japan as a civilized country.
Pevious treaties have assumed that the
native courts were so primitive and
punishments so brutal that it would
not be safe to trust American, Hritish
and other foreign citizens to native
tribunals, and the foreign consuls were
given extra territorial jurisdiction in
their great treaty ports of Japan.
Washington: The Chinese have lost
the finest and most powerful vessel of
their navy the great battleship Chen
Yuen, which stood the brunt of the
fighting1 at Yalu. The Chen Yuen in
leaving1 Wei-Hal-Wei harbor accident
ally struck a torpedo. Sho was
beached but was rendered useless for
lack of docking facilities. In despair
at tho catastrophe, the commander.
Commodore Lin, committed suicide.
CAN AICRE EXTRACT.
It Is to lie Manufactured on I.mrfe
Scale In the Pecos Valley of
Sew Mexico.
Hide and Leather, the voll-kiiown
organ of the leather industry in the
United States, made the important an
nouncement in a iccent issue that a
large factory is about to be erected iu
the Pecos valley of New Mexico for
the manufacture of canaigre extract.
This extract, which is for most kinds
of leather the very best tanning ma
terial known, is made from the root
of the canaigre plant, which grows in
certain portions of the arid region of
the United States and northern Mexico,
and with especial luxuriance under
irrigation in the Pecos valley, where
from ten to fifteen tons per acre are
grown. The cost of raising and har
vesting is no greater than in the case
of potatoes, and the farmers of the
Pecos valley arc assured of a market
for all they can raise, at 5( per ton,
which affords them a haudsome prolit;
and a considerable acreage is being
planted at the present time. When it
is known that Europe and America
consume about 5100,000,000 of tanning
materials annually, and that several
million dollars' worth of inferior sub
stances are each year imported intc
the United States, the importance ol
the industry can be appreciated. Large
numbers of farmers will doubtless gc
to the Pecos valley in the near future
to engage in this very profitable busi

New York: Dun's weekly trade review say:
There is ome change for the better. The gain
i siow ana in some direction not very dis
tinct, but the xigni of it arc a little more dean
ite than of late. Tne most important of them
is larger employment of labor, answering a
better demand on the whole for manufactured
products. Much of this is due to the unnat irai
delay of orders for thn winter, which resulted
from prolonged uncertainty, but it mean?
netunl increase in earnings and purchasing
power of the millions, and so given promtso ot
a larger demand in the tuture. Prices of farm
products in the aggregate do not Improve, but
the prevailing hopefulness is felt in somewhat
larger trusuvttons. The wheat market hat
lost the gain of the previous week Corn has
declined, revel pH having much.lncreased. The
.foreign demand for cotlixi continues. Textile
Industrie havo udded tew factories to the
working llt. ugalnst only one or two with
drawn, and there has- be7i eomo improvement
in the demand for woohnis. Sini'e August the
Rales of wool have been li per cent more than
lust year, but 3d per cent loss than In 1h;-.'.
Tho iron indu dry ugaln records lower price
for liespemer. The failures the past week
were 33-5 In tlio Uul;el Mates, against 3V last
year, and 31 In Canada, against 34 last year.
New York: Ursdstreefs trade review eavs:
The features of general trade for the past
week includo an increase in distribution of
holiday good, of heavy clothing, hats, season
able dry goods, and at various points, hard
ware and shoes. This was- stimulated by sea
sonably colder weather and continuance of the
feeling of confidence in a nearby Improvement
in demand. At the south a favrabie influence
is a mode ra to advance In the price of cotton.
The price of wool Is practically unchanged, os
are prices for hide, leather, lumber and print
cloths, although they are firmer. The tact
that demand for iron and tdreor has not fullv
kept puce with the production In made plain in
another reaction, bringing tho price on He,
semer down. Wheat, corn, sugar, pork and
lard are on the decline.
